# Below write your name and what part you would like to do for the project (back end or front end)


# Front end stack


# Front end goals


# Back end stack

Pytorch
Flask (for the model api)
Postgres (DBMS)

We need datasets Open Neuro (all sorts of scan types)
Open Neuro dataset: Lifestyle and other factors for Alzheimer’s + Neuroimaging

One that seemed interesting: (no scans, but lifestyle choices are included)
Mendeley Data: microbiota analysis of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease


# Back end goals
API - gets the image and converts the info to a storable state
Database - training data will be stored here (mostly will be a CSV format)


Accept MRI images from the front end which is converted to a feature space and fed to the model to assess alzheimer risks

Store patient information which can be used in perhaps a separate model to determine alzheimer risks based on lifestyle factors

# Basic outline of project

We are making medical software designed to assess Alzheimer risks based on MRI scans and lifestyle factors. We are going to use databases, machine learning, and web development tools to create a web based application that can be used by medical professionals. 

# Additional Notes/Thoughts

Feel free to add what you think will contribute to our end product or lead to a better outcome for the group. Also I left the web development tools part of the project kind of vague as i dont know barely anything about front end development. Anyone that knows what stack we might need for the front end could fill that in. Also ive used flask before for making python APIs but if there are any other API frameworks for any additional languages we want to use, add them too. Basically everything written here right now is a suggestion and can be changed. I'm also hoping once we start coding we can use this as the readme for the github.

Some resources for learning more about Alzheimer’s
Mayo Clinic: Diagnosis
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Detection via MRIs
Alzheimer’s vs Dementia
Clock Drawing Test Clock Test Study

It may be worth broadening MRI readings and predictions to other types of MCIs/diagnoses, Alzheimer’s detection with MRIs isn’t a definitive way to diagnose it at this time (blood tests seem most effective), scanning the clock drawings maybe?

We can also make a model for using various factors such as age, alcohol consumption, exercise, we can make that and we can have a an input prompt that takes various datatypes a healthcare provider would input into the software and be given a numerical risk assessment for Alzheimer's
