# FrontEnd (Reba)
The frontend is responsible for building the user-facing interface of the application. Using React with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, the frontend provides a secure login system, an upload form for MRI scans, and input fields for lifestyle data. Results generated by the backend and machine learning model are displayed on a clinician-friendly dashboard. This layer ensures that complex processes in the system are presented in a clear and accessible manner.

# Database Analytics (Juliet)
The data and analytics role manages the Postgres database and the lifestyle risk model. Responsibilities include designing schemas to store patient records, MRI study information, and lifestyle assessments. In addition, a lifestyle-based risk model is developed using statistical methods or machine learning techniques such as logistic regression or XGBoost. The model generates Alzheimer’s risk scores from structured lifestyle inputs and stores both the scores and explanatory factors in the database. This work ensures data integrity and provides the foundation for combining lifestyle and imaging-based assessments.

# Back End API (Husnain)
The backend is responsible for connecting all moving parts of the system through a secure and reliable architecture. Using Flask, APIs are built to accept MRI images and lifestyle data from the frontend, coordinate with the Postgres database to store patient records, and call the machine learning model to process imaging data. Once the individual risk scores are generated, the backend combines them into a single result and returns it to the frontend for display. Authentication and data protection are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information. In short, the backend serves as the central pipeline that enables communication across the entire project.


# Machine Learning (Gary)
The machine learning role is responsible for developing the core model using PyTorch. Responsibilities include preprocessing MRI scans, extracting meaningful features, and generating risk scores associated with Alzheimer’s. The model produces both numerical risk estimates and explanations of contributing features. These outputs are exposed through a service endpoint that can be called by the backend, ensuring seamless integration into the application. This role provides the intelligence layer that transforms raw imaging data into clinically meaningful insights.




We need datasets Open Neuro (all sorts of scan types)
Open Neuro dataset: Lifestyle and other factors for Alzheimer’s + Neuroimaging

One that seemed interesting: (no scans, but lifestyle choices are included)
Mendeley Data: microbiota analysis of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease


# Basic outline of project

We are making medical software designed to assess Alzheimer risks based on MRI scans and lifestyle factors. We are going to use databases, machine learning, and web development tools to create a web based application that can be used by medical professionals. 

# Additional Notes/Thoughts

Feel free to add what you think will contribute to our end product or lead to a better outcome for the group. Also I left the web development tools part of the project kind of vague as i dont know barely anything about front end development. Anyone that knows what stack we might need for the front end could fill that in. Also ive used flask before for making python APIs but if there are any other API frameworks for any additional languages we want to use, add them too. Basically everything written here right now is a suggestion and can be changed. I'm also hoping once we start coding we can use this as the readme for the github.

Some resources for learning more about Alzheimer’s
Mayo Clinic: Diagnosis
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Detection via MRIs
Alzheimer’s vs Dementia
Clock Drawing Test Clock Test Study

It may be worth broadening MRI readings and predictions to other types of MCIs/diagnoses, Alzheimer’s detection with MRIs isn’t a definitive way to diagnose it at this time (blood tests seem most effective), scanning the clock drawings maybe?

We can also make a model for using various factors such as age, alcohol consumption, exercise, we can make that and we can have a an input prompt that takes various datatypes a healthcare provider would input into the software and be given a numerical risk assessment for Alzheimer's
