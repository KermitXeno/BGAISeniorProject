BEFORE YOU START WORKING ON THE MODEL RUN THE TRAIN BIO AND TRAIN MRI SCRIPTS TO ENSURE THE MODEL KERAS FILES EXIST

The first page of the frontend should be a dashboard which lets the user select between the three models
the bio model, the mri model and the EEG model, upon selecting one the user will be taken to a page where 
they have a form to input information/files to be passed to the model for predictions, once the model has made predictions 
the results will be displayed to the user

THE BIO MODEL

input field consists of 8 values
M/F  Age  EDUC  SES  MMSE  eTIV  nWBV   ASF
M/f = 1 or 0
age = int
educ = int
SES = float
MMSE = Float
eTIV = int
nWBV = float
ASF = float

the page for this model should have 8 fields for inputing these values which will be sent to the api
which should returns a list of four float values from the model

please consult the CrossSectionalCleaning.ipynb file in the db connection directory for more information on
avove stated inputs.

when the model returns it will give a list of 4 floats, with the first being the chance of no dementia
with the last being the highest level of dementia the model is trained on

i will leave it up to you three on how you will comunicate this information to the user and display it in a
more user friendly manner (graphs, charts, etc)

THE MRI MODEL

this page will prompt the user to upload an image to the webpage which will be sent to the model via the api and be
given back a prediction in the form of a list of 4 floats similar to the bio model, once again how this information 
is communicated to the user is up to you guys, the model simply will take input and give output black box style.

THE EEG MODEL

im still working on that one so be patient ill update this soon for now have the page in the frontend but say its
under construction
